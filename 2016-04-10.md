### RB Tree and AVL Tree
What's the main aim we are chossing Red black tree instead of Avl tree?  
Both red-black trees and AVL trees are the most commonly used balanced binary search trees and they support insertion, deletion and look-up in guaranteed O(logN) time. However, there are following points of comparison between the two:  

AVL trees are more rigidly balanced and hence provide faster look-ups. Thus for a look-up intensive task use an AVL tree.  
For an insert intensive taks, use a Red-Black tree.  
AVL trees store the balance factor at each node. This takes O(N) extra space. However, if we know that the keys that will be inserted in the tree will always be greater than zero, we can use the sign bit of the keys to store the colour information of a red-black tree.   Thus, in such cases red-black tree takes O(1) extra space.  
In general, the rotations for an AVL tree are harder to implement and debug than that for a Red-Black tree.  
What are the application of Red black tree?  
Red-black trees are more general purpose. They do relatively well on add, remove, and look-up but AVL trees have faster look-ups at the cost of slower add/remove. Red-black tree is used in the following:  

Java: java.util.TreeMap , java.util.TreeSet .  
C++ STL: map, multimap, multiset.  
Linux kernel: completely fair scheduler, linux/rbtree.h
