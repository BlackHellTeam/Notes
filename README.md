# Notes
Keep foolish, keep hungry.

This repository is for collecting notes and pushing me forward.  
1. **DO NOT** reprint any article here. Because I don't own the authority of some sentences or articles here.  
2. If you find something wrong here, just make an issue.  
3. I push myself to study everyday. And you can watch this for new notes everyday.

此仓库仅作为个人笔记之用。
1. **请勿**转载，因为我没有对其中某些句子或者文章拥有著作权。
2. 如果您发现笔记有误，请在issue中提出。
3. 我强迫自己每天学习并尽量记笔记。你可以通过watch功能来获取每天的新笔记。
